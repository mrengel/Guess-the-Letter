Psychic-Game

A JavaScript app that randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.

When the player wins, the Wins counter increases and the game starts over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, the Losses counter increases and the game restarts without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
